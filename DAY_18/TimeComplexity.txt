Time Complexity: The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.

Type of Time Complexity 
1. Worst Case --> O(n)
2. Best Case --> omega(n)
3. Average Case --> thita (n)
